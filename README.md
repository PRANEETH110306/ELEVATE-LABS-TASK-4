# TASK 4
# Spider-Verse Quote Generator (Responsive Web Project)

## Objective
Create a **mobile-friendly Spider-Verse quote generator** using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays random quotes from the Spider-Man universe with background images adapting based on screen size. Since the task mentioned using an existing desktop site, I chose to reuse my previous Spider-Verse webpage from Task 1 and made it fully responsive using CSS media queries.
